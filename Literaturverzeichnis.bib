  abstract = {Process mining, as with any form of data analysis, relies heavily on the quality of input data to generate accurate and reliable results. A fit-for-purpose event log nearly always requires time-consuming, manual pre-processing to extract events from source data, with data quality dependent on the analyst's domain knowledge and skills. Despite much being written about data quality in general, a generalisable framework for analysing event data quality issues when extracting logs for process mining remains unrealised. Following the DSR paradigm, we present RDB2Log, a quality-aware, semi-automated approach for extracting event logs from relational data. We validated RDB2Log's design against design objectives extracted from literature and competing artifacts, evaluated its design and performance with process mining experts, implemented a prototype with a defined set of quality metrics, and applied it in laboratory settings and in a real-world case study. The evaluation shows that RDB2Log is understandable, of relevance in current research, and supports process mining in practice.},

  abstract = {The execution of business processes generates a lot of data representing happenings (also called events) that may be utilized for process monitoring and analysis. This, however, is not supported by typical Business Process Management Systems (BPMSs). Especially, in manual executing business process environments, i.e., not driven by a BPMS, the correlation of events to processes for monitoring and analysis is not trivial. At design-time, Process Event Monitoring Points are used in process models to specify the locations, where particular events are expected. Therewith, occurring events can be assigned to a process during run-time. In this paper, we introduce an extension to BPMN, which implements this connection between process models and events. We show applicability of this extension by applying it to a logistics scenario taken from an EU project.},

  abstract = {In the context of the ongoing digitalization, the competitiveness of companies is increasingly dependent on their ability to innovate data-driven business models. However, this poses major challenges for companies, and so, data-driven business models, once they have been implemented on the market, often fall short of expectations in terms of value realization, e.g. in the form of revenues or cost savings. In particular, this is due to the fact that value-realizing or value-reducing influencing factors often only become apparent after the implementation in the market. At this point, companies lack concrete procedure models to counter these influencing factors and to successfully implement data-driven business models and realize value. By means of a design science research approach, this study develops an interview- and workshop-based procedure model that enables practitioners to implement and realize value from data-driven business models. The application of the procedure model in five data-driven business models of a German premium car manufacturer has shown that it offers practitioners useful support. For example, it provides an easy-to-understand methodological approach that helps to identify and evaluate value-realizing and value-reducing influencing factors, promote crossfunctional, shared knowledge on value realization, decision factors and the leveraging effects of different measures. Additionally, the assignment of limited company resources to the implementation of different measures in relation to their effects is considered.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the catchword “low-code” has evolved into what can be seen as a major trend in software development platforms. A growing number of vendors respond to this trend by offering software development platforms that promise limited need for coding only and a tremendous boost in productivity. Both aspects have been the subject of intensive research over many years in areas such as domain-specific modeling languages, model-driven software development, or generative programming. Therefore, the obvious question is how "low code" platforms differ from such approaches and what specific performance features they offer. Since there is no unified definition of “low-code”, the only way to develop an elaborate understanding of what it is – and might be – is to analyze the actual use of the term. For obvious reasons, it is not promising in this respect to rely on marketing announcements made by vendors. Instead, it seems more appropriate to examine “low-code” platforms. This research report presents a study of 10 relevant platforms, capturing and assessing common characteristics as well as specific features of individual tools. The study is guided by a method that consists of a conceptual framework, which provides a uniform structure to describe and compare “lowcode” platforms, and a process model that describes the sequence of steps.},

Despite its significance the effects of BD on decision-making quality has been given scant attention in the literature. In this paper factors influencing decision-making based on BD are identified using a case study. BD is collected from different sources that have various data qualities and are processed by various organizational entities resulting in the creation of a big data chain. The veracity (manipulation, noise), variety (heterogeneity of data) and velocity (constantly changing data sources) amplified by the size of big data calls for relational and contractual governance mechanisms to ensure BD quality and being able to contextualize data. The case study reveals that taking advantage of big data is an evolutionary process in which the gradually understanding of the potential of big data and the routinization of processes plays a crucial role.},

  abstract = {Objective: This paper examines the current literature about low-code and no-code to discover more about them and their relationship with usability, particularly its quality, which factors are the most relevant, and how users view these tools. This focus on usability aims to provide a different point of view from other works on low-code. Method: We performed a systematic literature review based on a formal protocol for this study. The search protocol returned a total of 207 peer-review articles across five databases, which was supplemented with a snowballing process. These were filtered using inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 38 relevant articles that were analysed, synthesised and reported. Conclusion: Despite growing interest and a strong enterprise presence in academia, we did not find a formal definition of low-code, although common characteristics have been specified. We found that users have a heightened awareness of usability regarding low-code tools, with some authors performing feasibility studies on their implementations or listing factors that influence the user experience in a given tool. Researchers are considering usability factors unconsciously, and the low-code field would grow if research on usability increased. This paper also suggests a definition for low-code development.},

The data warehouse supports on-line analytical processing (OLAP), the functional and performance requirements of which are quite different from those of the on-line transaction processing (OLTP) applications traditionally supported by the operational databases. Data warehouses provide on-line analytical processing (OLAP) tools for the interactive analysis of multidimensional data of varied granularities, which facilitates effective data mining. Data warehousing and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) are essential elements of decision support, which has increasingly become a focus of the database industry. OLTP is customer-oriented and is used for transaction and query processing by clerks, clients and information technology professionals. An OLAP system is market-oriented and is used for data analysis by knowledge workers, including managers, executives and analysts. Data warehousing and OLAP have emerged as leading technologies that facilitate data storage, organization and then, significant retrieval. Decision support places some rather different requirements on database technology compared to traditional on-line transaction processing applications.},

Nevertheless, thus far, the conceptual foundations and specific characteristics of corresponding business models have been only insufficiently researched and systematized. Based on relevant prior works, in this foundations paper, we introduce three main types of DDBMs (data users, data suppliers, and data facilitators) and provide an overview of key “data-driven” concepts, which we integrate into a conceptual framework for characterizing DDBMs. To illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the three DDBM types and the developed framework, we present three real-world examples (KAESER, Shell Telematics, and Celonis). The paper concludes with a discussion of promising directions for future research on DDBMs.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) has proven largely successful in increasing the competitiveness of a large variety of organizations by fostering the efficiency of operations within and between organizations around the globe. In this book, we show how BPM can also contribute extensively to the innovativeness of organizations in leveraging new technology of the digital age. Consequently, BPM can contribute to one of the most important challenges of our modern economies and societies, which is to sustain wealth by means of new business models. In featuring the views of global thought leaders, we showcase not only the potential of BPM but also the need of the discipline to further develop in order to take on this new role. This book has been initiated in the context of the European BPM Round Table that took place in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, in May 2014 on the theme, “Business Process Management—Driving Innovation in a Digital World” (www.bpm-round table2014.eu). The idea of a BPM Round Table at a European level emerged from several local BPM Round Tables that were established in Europe over the last years. The first European BPM Round Table took place in Eindhoven in 2012 with the objective to broadly exchange knowledge and experience between experts from business, administration, and science. We would like to express our gratitude for having had the opportunity to host the 2nd European BPM Round Table in Liechtenstein and would like to particularly thank Wil van der Aalst and Hajo Reijers for suggesting Vaduz as the venue for the event. In addition, we are also deeply thankful for the large support we received from the Eindhoven University of Technology and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology for its realization. Also, the strong sponsorship from industry has been instrumental in the successful organization of the European BPM Round Table in Liechtenstein: The Hilti AG contributed as a platinum sponsor, Camelot ITLab and Swarovski as gold sponsors, Ivoclar Vivadent and mbpi as silver sponsors, and Hoval as bronze sponsors. We, therefore, cordially thank all company representatives for contributing to the success of the event. Further, we extend our thanks to the University of Liechtenstein for the additional funds that were provided in order to host the event. We would also like to thank the organizing team, especially Nadine Reuter and Nicole Tho ̈ny, as well as the whole team of the Institute of Information Systems for their excellent work in preparing the conference and making every guest feel comfortable during their visit at our University. Finally, our special thanks go to the authors of this book. The contributions in this book are essentially based on the insightful talks the authors gave at the Round Table in Liechtenstein. In addition, the book also includes further authors who we invited from beyond the framework of the event. We would like to cordially thank all contributors for their efforts in bringing their work, experience, and ideas to paper. All chapters have undergone a thorough review process and we are very grateful for the effort both reviewers and authors have made in making our vision of this BPM book focusing on innovation in a digital world come true. They all share the spirit that it is important to emphasize the strong contribution BPM can make to the economy and society, and that it is the right time to demonstrate BPM’s contribution by means of this book. Companies are advised to focus on their capabilities to manage business processes as a means to increase their agility in mastering innovation and transformation efforts. The book shows that a rich body of knowledge is available that can be applied right away. The book also addresses researchers, for these to engage in further developing this body of knowledge to better account for the new role of BPM as a driver and facilitator of innovation. We are confident that the research underlying this book and the discussions of the topics at the European BPM Round Table in Liechtenstein are inspirational for driving innovations in the context of BPM. It has been a pleasure and privilege to work with all the people involved and we hope that a lot of positive developments will emerge from this work.},

  abstract = {Logs are imperative in the development and maintenance process of many software systems. They record detailed runtime information that allows developers and support engineers to monitor their systems and dissect anomalous behaviors and errors. The increasing scale and complexity of modern software systems, however, make the volume of logs explodes. In many cases, the traditional way of manual log inspection becomes impractical. Many recent studies, as well as industrial tools, resort to powerful text search and machine learning-based analytics solutions. Due to the unstructured nature of logs, a first crucial step is to parse log messages into structured data for subsequent analysis. In recent years, automated log parsing has been widely studied in both academia and industry, producing a series of log parsers by different techniques. To better understand the characteristics of these log parsers, in this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation study on automated log parsing and further release the tools and benchmarks for easy reuse. More specifically, we evaluate 13 log parsers on a total of 16 log datasets spanning distributed systems, supercomputers, operating systems, mobile systems, server applications, and standalone software. We report the benchmarking results in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, which are of practical importance when deploying automated log parsing in production. We also share the success stories and lessons learned in an industrial application at Huawei. We believe that our work could serve as the basis and provide valuable guidance to future research and deployment of automated log parsing.},
